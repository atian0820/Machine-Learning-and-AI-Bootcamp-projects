# Capstone Project: Data Collection 

Here are the three datasets I explored:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norbertelter/pcb-defect-dataset/data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhatova/pcb-defects
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/animeshkumarnayak/pcb-fault-detection

The one that I choose:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/norbertelter/pcb-defect-dataset/data

Above dataset includes a diverse range of defect types, such as missing holes, mouse bites, open circuits, shorts, spurs, and spurious copper. I believe, its extensive sample set provides the necessary data to build a robust model for PCB defect detection. Utilizing this dataset will allow me to train a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying and classifying defects, ultimately aiding in the automation of the inspection process and enhancing our predictive capabilities.
